    <strong>Step 1 :</strong> Extract it in htdocs.<br>
    <strong>Step 2 :</strong> Make migration.<br>
    <strong>Step 3 :</strong> You will get error in migration after half completed. Therefore manually go to myphpadmin and create another table name "administrators".<br>
    <strong>Step 4 :</strong> Rename "post" table from database(myphpadmin) and change it to "posts". or change table name from models in Post.php file and table       name  into post from posts.<br>
    <strong>Step 5 :</strong> Change "email" into "username" from "administrators" table in myphpadmin.<br>
    <strong>Step 6 :</strong> Run the code.
